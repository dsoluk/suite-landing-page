## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (just colors)
- Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My first Junior level challenge. So far, I've been able to get more comfortable with different strategies to position elements, including overlapping. Had to re-work a bunch as I moved through mobile to tablet to desktop. Lots of back and forth trying to adjust overlays but forced me to understand better...hopefully I can demonstrate in next challenge...ugh!

### Continued development

Got to get faster. Got stumped a few times (overlays) but now able to work through using different strategies (e.g. transform: translate). Using CodePen to simplify and solve.

Amount of css code seems long (~550 lines) which I think is due to overuse of media queries and px (to try to match up to solution / Figma positioning as close as possible). Thinking code can be more efficient by using min-width, max-width, %'ages to be more responsive (and maybe slightly less accurate to solution)

### Useful resources

W3, MDN, LinkedIn and CodePen
