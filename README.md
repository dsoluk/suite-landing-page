## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My first Junio level challenge. So far, I've been able to get more comfortable with different strategies to position elements, including overlapping.

### Continued development

Got to get faster. Got stumped a bit but now able to work through different strategies. Using CodePen to simplify and solve.

### Useful resources

W3, MDN, LinkedIn and CodePen
